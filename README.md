This is supposed to generate Polandball comics, but 3D rendering using
paintbrush tools is hard. It contains a decently-sized art suite,
though, and someday I'll finish it. `example.pbc` is a minimal example
of the kind of input I'd like it to take. This entire project was
cannibalized to build the `shitty-polandball` repository.
